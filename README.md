# Comfy Store

Comfy Store is a Vanilla JavaScript project that demonstrates the creation of an e-commerce website without a backend. It fetches product information from an API and displays it on the website. This project serves as a valuable learning resource for front-end developers looking to build dynamic and interactive web applications using JavaScript.

## Features
__Product Listing__: Display a wide range of products with details such as name, price, and description.<br/>
__Filtering__: Implement product filtering based on various criteria like category, price range, and more.<br/>
__Cart Management__: Allow users to add products to their shopping cart, view cart contents, and proceed to checkout.<br/>
__Dynamic Updates__: Utilize JavaScript to dynamically update the user interface without requiring page reloads.<br/>

## Getting Started
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/rinkikhandal/javaScript_practice.git
```
Open the index.html file in your web browser.

Explore the e-commerce website, browse products, and interact with the shopping cart.

## Usage
Customize the project by adding more product data to the API or modifying the website's appearance.
Experiment with different JavaScript functionalities and further enhance the user experience.
